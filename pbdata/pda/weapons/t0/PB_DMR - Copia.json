Requires very little weapon expertise to operate and withstands extreme temperatures, moisture and mud.\nIn its standard configuration it sports a holographic sight that integrates into your helmet for digital zooming and a 31-round magazine. Its modularity allows for upgrades such as replacement stocks, muzzle devices and custom recievers."
